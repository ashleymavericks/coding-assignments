## Key Components

1. Custom Exception Handling: Specialized exceptions extend HTTPException with specific status codes and messages. This creates consistent and informative error responses across the API.

2. Rate Limiting: Implements a sliding window rate limiter that tracks requests per client ID. Requests exceeding defined thresholds within the time window are automatically rejected.

3. Optimistic Locking: Uses a version field to prevent concurrent updates from overwriting each other. System verifies version matches before applying updates, then increments the version counter.

4. Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevents cascading failures by temporarily disabling operations that fail frequently. Tracks failure counts and automatically disables problematic operations, re-enabling them after a timeout period.

5. Response Caching: Caches product data with configurable TTL to reduce database load. Cache entries are automatically invalidated when products are updated or when TTL expires.

6. Background Tasks: Handles cleanup operations and webhook processing asynchronously. This prevents blocking API responses while performing maintenance tasks.

7. Real-time Notifications: Uses publish-subscribe pattern with asyncio.Queue to deliver real-time product updates. Changes are streamed to clients via server-sent events (SSE).

8. Bulk Operations: Provides endpoints for updating multiple products in a single request. Supports partial success, allowing some operations to succeed while others fail independently.

9. Request Tracing: Attaches unique IDs and timing information to each request. This data simplifies debugging and enables effective performance monitoring.
